# Overview

As a software engineer, my goal is to develop data analysis skills to identify patterns, trends, and insights from large datasets. For this project, I worked with an e-commerce sales dataset to analyze sales performance, product profitability, and revenue patterns. This experience allowed me to deepen my understanding of data cleaning, aggregation, and visualization techniques using Python and popular libraries like Pandas and Matplotlib.

The dataset I analyzed was obtained from a publicly available e-commerce sales CSV file, which contains information about products sold, quantities, prices, order dates, and other relevant details. This data set is specically Amazon clothing sales in India. The link to the dataset is provided below.

The purpose of this software is to help identify the top-selling products, the most profitable products, and trends in monthly revenue. By analyzing the dataset, we can draw meaningful insights about the business and suggest areas for potential improvement.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration.  It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the data set, the questions and answers, the code running and a walkthrough of the code.}

# Data Analysis Results

During the analysis, I answered the following questions based on the dataset:

### Top 5 Most Sold Products (by Quantity):

The products with the highest quantity sold were identified, allowing insight into the most popular products.

### Monthly Revenue:

The total revenue generated per month was calculated, revealing trends in sales and identifying the month with the highest revenue.

### Most Profitable Products (by Revenue):

The products generating the highest revenue were identified, providing a clear view of the most lucrative items for the business.

# Development Environment

For this project, I used the following tools and technologies:

Programming Language: Python 3.14

### Libraries Used:
* Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.

* Matplotlib: For creating visualizations like bar charts.

* Matplotlib Ticker: To format axis labels for better readability in visualizations.

The code was developed using Jupyter Notebook for easy execution and visualization of the analysis results.

# Future Work

There are several areas that I plan to improve and expand upon in the future:

* Add more Data Visualizations: Create additional visualizations, such as line charts for revenue over time or heatmaps for correlation analysis.

* Handle Missing Values: Implement more sophisticated methods for handling missing or invalid data instead of simply dropping rows.

* Incorporate Machine Learning: Explore using machine learning models for sales forecasting or product recommendation.

* Optimize Performance: Improve performance by handling larger datasets more efficiently, possibly by using Dask or other distributed computing techniques.
